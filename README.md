# vsdep

This action copies the dlls from vintage story to the specified path which allows for compilation of mods on CI.

This is a proof of concept. See https://github.com/Amzd/vsmods for usage.

TODO: This should probably download the dlls straight from vintagestory.net instead of requiring someone to upload them?
TODO: How to do mod dependencies?
